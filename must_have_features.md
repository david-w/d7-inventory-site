1. Easy way to deal with carton quantities.

  - An exact reprint of an SKU may result in different carton quantities. If that occurs and there is still previous stock in inventory, we end up with multiple carton quantities for the same SKU.
  
  - Customer usually orders by carton (2x Item C) but occasionally will order by exact quantity needed. (10,000 Item C)
  
  - Print orders rarely fill an even number of cartons.  We usually end up with one smaller "short" carton. 
  
2. Inventory transactions.
