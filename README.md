# d7-inventory-site

This is a migration / upgrade of a customer facing inventory management and ordering system I developed in 2008 using Drupal 6.   The current plan is to develop a new site in Drupal 7, and import the data from the current Drupal 6 site.  After all bugs are worked out, migrate from Drupal to Backdrop since Drupal 8 is headed in a different direction.

This will be a long-term project because many of the modules I used in D6 are simply not available for D7.


### UPDATE February, 2020:
Considering the amount of time that has passed, I feel the best path going forward is to create a new site in Backdrop and import the data from the D6 site. (which is still in operation)  I will research Drupal 6 database import in Backdrop when I have some time.

### UPDATE December, 2024:
I made a job move in 2021 so this project is dead.  From what I understand, the d6 site is still active and in use.
