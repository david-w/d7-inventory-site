# d7-inventory-site

This is a migration / upgrade of a customer facing inventory management and ordering system I developed in 2008 using Drupal 6.   The current plan is to develop a new site in Drupal 7, and import the data from the current Drupal 6 site.  After all bugs are worked out, migrate from Drupal to Backdrop since Drupal 8 is headed in a different direction.

This will be a long-term project because many of the modules I used in D6 are simply not available for D7.
